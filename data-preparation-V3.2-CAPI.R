#####Standard Scripts for RMS CAPI Data Preparation###
######################################################

##Date: October 2024


##Remove past activities

rm(list = ls())

####Load libraries and data ----

# Install pacman if not already installed
if(!require(pacman)) install.packages('pacman')


# Load all required libraries using pacman
pacman::p_load(
  tidyverse, dplyr, tidyr, rlang, purrr, magrittr, expss, srvyr, 
  readr, labelled, pastecs, psych, tableone, outbreaks, ggplot2, 
  unhcrthemes, scales, gt, webshot2, sjlabelled, waffle, writexl, 
  haven, readxl, dm, janitor, visdat, DiagrammeR, robotoolbox, remotes
)

####Once you load all packages, you can import your data directly from KoBO.

###Insert your username and password from UNHCR Kobo server. 
####Note that you need to have access to the survey from your account to be able to upload it directly



###Enter your KoBo username and password
kobo_token(username = "xxxx",
           password = "xxxx",
           url = "https://kobo.unhcr.org")


###Once you enter, you will receive your token from KoBO which you need to insert as below

kobo_setup(url = "https://kobo.unhcr.org",
           token = "xxxx")

###Run the script below to see list of your surveys 
asset_list <- kobo_asset_list()

asset_list

##Find the survey you want to analyse and enter the name as below 

uid <- filter(asset_list, name == "RMS CAPI v3") |> ## change the name accordingly
  pull(uid)

###You will see the number of submissions and name. 

asset <- kobo_asset(uid)
asset


###Your data frame will be displayed here without the need for you to download it from KoBo
df <- kobo_data(asset)
df

## Get individual tables from data frame object if needed

main <- pull_tbl(df, main, keyed = TRUE)
S1 <- pull_tbl(df, S1, keyed = TRUE)
S2_repeat <- pull_tbl(df, S2_repeat, keyed = TRUE)


####As a second option, you can import datasets directly in R
###If you do so, please make sure to download your data from KoBo by selecting options as below:
######1. Select export type: XLS
######2. Value and Header format: XML values and headers


####RMS dataset will have 2 other sheets due to individual level questions. 
####Export them separately by precising the name of the sheet as below

library(readxl)
main <- read_excel("Enter file path")
S1 <- read_excel("Enter file path", 
                 sheet = "S1")
S2_repeat <- read_excel("Enter file path", 
                        sheet = "S2_repeat")



#####At this step, you should already have your dataset uploaded as below
###Please use the same variable names, otherwise this script won't work

glimpse(df$main)
glimpse(df$S1)
glimpse(df$S2_repeat)




#################################
####Review your datasets 
#################################

#Check repeat group datasets
dm_draw(df)

### Check the columns
glimpse(df)

##Check number of entries in each sheet
dm_nrow(df)


#### You can pull below three datasets

main <- pull_tbl(df, main, keyed = FALSE)
S1 <- pull_tbl(df, S1, keyed = FALSE)
S2_repeat <- pull_tbl(df, S2_repeat, keyed = FALSE)

##Merge all individual level dataset into one single individual dataset

S1 <- pull_tbl(df, S1, keyed = FALSE)
S2_repeat <- pull_tbl(df, S2_repeat, keyed = FALSE)

ind <- S1 |>
  left_join(S2_repeat, by = c("_index", "_parent_index")) 


#Now you should have only two datasets one is called 'main' for household level questions 
###and other one is called 'ind' for individual level questions


###Remove all other datasets that are not needed

rm(asset,asset_list,df,P2.3,S1, S2_repeat)


####Data cleaning for ind and main datasets

###Before you start creating variables for further disaggregation, DO THE PRIMARY DATA CLEANING (missing values, duplicates)
###You can get inspired from below steps to help you with your primary cleaning
###You will continue with data cleaning once you create your disaggregation variables 


###Step 1. Check duplicates

duplicated(main) # Check if there are any duplicates
sum(duplicated(main)) # Number of duplicates


duplicated(ind) # Check if there are any duplicates
sum(duplicated(ind)) #Number of duplicates

get_dupes(main)
get_dupes(ind)


###DELETE IF YOU HAVE ANY DUPLICATES!

##Step 2. Check for missing data
####R provides functions like is.na(), complete.cases(), and na.omit() for handling missing values. 
###The tidyr package's drop_na() function is also useful for removing rows with missing data
###Check for certain variables to see if there are any missing values

###Missing ind Analysis: Visualize the extent of missing ind using bar charts or heatmaps to identify patterns of missingness.

# Example of a missing ind heatmap using the `visdat` package


vis_dat(main)


#####Calculate disaggregation variables

####Calculate population groups from the mobility section to confirm population group
### If you were surveying internally displaced persons, you can run the code below and compare with the actual
##population groups entered at the beginning




####IDPs 

###EGRISS defines IDPs as those who have been forcibly displaced , including preventative movements, by:
###Armed conflit; generalised violence; violations of human rights; natural or human-made disasters; other forced displacement or evictions


table(ind$IDP01_1) # Armed conflict
table(ind$IDP01_2) # Generalised Violence
table(ind$IDP01_3) # Persecution and or violations of human rights
table(ind$IDP01_4) # Natural or human-made disasters
table(ind$IDP01_5) # Other forced displacement or evictions
table(ind$IDP01_6) # Other voluntary movements
table(ind$IDP01_7) # Never moved home while in ${countryname}
table(ind$IDP01_98) # Don't know
table(ind$IDP01_99) # Prefer not to respond

ind <- ind %>%
  mutate(idp_valid=
           case_when(IDP01_1==1 | IDP01_2==1 | IDP01_3==1 | IDP01_4==1 | IDP01_5==1 ~ 1, 
                     IDP01_6==0 | IDP01_7==0 ~ 0,
                     TRUE ~ NA_real_)
  ) %>%
  mutate(idp_valid = labelled(idp_valid,
                              labels = c(
                                "Not an internally displaced person" = 0,
                                "Internatlly displaced person" = 1)
                              
  ))




###Check the results and compare with population group selected for the household for ind cleaning
table(ind$idp_valid)


####Refugees and Asylum Seekers

###You should check the primary citizenship of all household members and confirm that 
####refugees and asylum seekers are NOT the citizens of the country of enumeration

###Primary citizenship



ind <- ind %>%
  mutate( 
    # primary citizenship from REF01 and REF02
    citizenship = case_when(
      REF01 == "1" ~ "XXX",  # here enter the country code (where RMS took place)
      REF01 %in% c("0", "98") ~ as.character(REF02),
      REF01 == "99" ~ "99"
    )
  ) %>%
  mutate(citizenship = labelled(
    citizenship,
    labels = setNames(val_labels(ind$REF02), val_labels(ind$REF02)),
    label = var_label(ind$REF02)
  ))




table(ind$citizenship)

#####Age groups

ind$HH07_cat <- cut(ind$HH07,
                    breaks = c(-1, 4, 17, 59, Inf),
                    labels = c("0-4", "5-17", "18-59", "60+"))
ind$HH07_cat2 <- cut(ind$HH07 ,
                     breaks = c(-1, 17, Inf),
                     labels = c("0-17", "18-60+"))

table(ind$HH07_cat)
table(ind$HH07_cat2)


### Disability

####The calculation for this section is standard. For more details, please refer here: https://www.washingtongroup-disability.com/fileadmin/uploads/wg/WG_Document__7A_-_Analytic_Guidelines_for_the_WG-SS_Enhanced__SPSS_.pdf

###Step 1: Generate frequency distributions on each of the six WG-SS domain variables

### 1	No difficulty
### 2	Some difficulty
### 3	A lot of difficulties
### 4	Cannot do at all
### 98	Don’t know
### 99	Prefer not to respond

#Vision
barplot(table(ind$DIS01), main = "Vision")
#Hearing
barplot(table(ind$DIS02), main = "Hearing")
#Mobility
barplot(table(ind$DIS03), main = "Mobility")
#Communication
barplot(table(ind$DIS04), main = "Communication")
#Self-care
barplot(table(ind$DIS05), main = "Self-care")
#Cognition
barplot(table(ind$DIS06), main = "Cognition")


#######Step 2. Codes (99) Prefer not to respond and (98) Don’t know, are recoded to Missing.


#######Create function that turn character values into numeric if you imported your ind from KobO

labelled_chr2dbl <- function(x) {
  varlab <- var_label(x)
  vallab <- val_labels(x)
  vallab <- setNames(as.numeric(vallab),
                     names(vallab))
  x <- as.numeric(as.character(x))
  var_label(x) <- varlab
  val_labels(x) <- vallab
  x
}



# Replace "98"  and "99" with "NA" using dplyr

ind <- ind %>%
  mutate(
    DIS01 = ifelse(DIS01 == "98" | DIS01 == "99", NA, DIS01),
    DIS02 = ifelse(DIS02 == "98" | DIS02 == "99", NA, DIS02),
    DIS03 = ifelse(DIS03 == "98" | DIS03 == "99", NA, DIS03),
    DIS04 = ifelse(DIS04 == "98" | DIS04 == "99", NA, DIS04),
    DIS05 = ifelse(DIS05 == "98" | DIS05 == "99", NA, DIS05),
    DIS06 = ifelse(DIS06 == "98" | DIS06 == "99", NA, DIS06)
  )


####Double check for missing values

frequencies_DIS01 <- table(ind$DIS01, useNA = "ifany")
print(frequencies_DIS01)



####Create disability status indicator for the Washington Group short set on disability


ind$disability<- 0

ind <- ind %>%
  mutate(disability = ifelse(
    DIS01 %in% c(3, 4) |
      DIS02 %in% c(3, 4) |
      DIS03 %in% c(3, 4) |
      DIS04 %in% c(3, 4) |
      DIS05 %in% c(3, 4) |
      DIS06 %in% c(3, 4),
    1,
    disability
  ))



##Put the labels


ind <- ind %>%
  mutate(disability = factor(disability, levels = c(0, 1), labels = c("Non-disabled", "Disabled")))


####Check final frequencies

table(ind$disability)


###Below indicators will be used to disaggregate during the analysis.
##Country of origin : `citizenship`
##Age categories : `HH07_cat` and `HH07_cat2`
##Gender : `HH04`
##Population groups: `pop_groups`
###Disability: disability

table(main$pop_groups)
table(ind$HH04)

##Label the variables below 

pop_groups_labels <- c(
  "1" = "Asylum-seekers",
  "2" = "Refugees",
  "3" = "People in a refugee-like situation",
  "4" = "Refugee returnees",
  "5" = "IDPs",
  "6" = "IDP returnees",
  "7" = "Stateless people",
  "8" = "Host communities"
)

main <- main %>%
  mutate(pop_groups = recode_factor(pop_groups, !!!setNames(as.character(pop_groups_labels), as.character(seq_along(pop_groups_labels)))))


##Label HH04 - sex variable


# Define labels for HH04
HH04_labels <- c(
  "1" = "Female",
  "2" = "Male",
  "3" = "Intersex",
  "99" = "Prefer not to respond"
)

ind <- ind %>%
  mutate(HH04 = recode_factor(HH04, !!!setNames(as.character(HH04_labels), as.character(seq_along(HH04_labels)))))



###Put labels for EDU1_random - education variable for randomly selected adult


main <- main %>%
  mutate(EDU01_random = factor(EDU01_random, 
                               levels = c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 98, 99),
                               labels = c("No formal education",
                                          "Informal schooling only",
                                          "Less than primary education",
                                          "Primary school completed",
                                          "Lower secondary school completed",
                                          "Upper secondary school completed",
                                          "Post-secondary non-tertiary education",
                                          "Bachelor/equivalent degree completed",
                                          "Masters/equivalent degree or above",
                                          "Don't know",
                                          "Prefer not to respond")))


table(main$EDU01_random)

#####MERGE DISAGGREGATION VARIABLES FROM INDIVIDUAL TO HOUSEHOLD DATASET####

####RANDOMLY SELECTED ADULT  


###Run this step if only you have extra variable for the first selected with the same name
main$name_selectedfirst <- ifelse(is.na(main$name_selectedadult18), main$name_selectedadult18_1, main$name_selectedadult18)

table(main$name_selectedfirst)


###Create a variable called random_adult to match with the main dataset

main <- main %>%
  mutate(random_adult=case_when(
    random_present %in% c(1,3) ~ name_selectedfirst,
    random_present_2 %in% c(1,3) ~ name_selectedadult18_2,
    TRUE ~ name_respondent)
  )


table(main$random_adult)



##Create a new dataset with indicators for merge, below you can add all other indicators you want to import from individual dataset



ind_m <- ind %>% ###Here below add idp_valid if only you have IDPs 
  select("_parent_index", "HH07_cat", "HH07_cat2", "disability",
         "citizenship","idp_valid", "HH07", "HH04", "HH03", "name_individual", "HH01" ) 



main <- left_join(main, ind_m,
                  by = c("random_adult"="name_individual", "_index" = "_parent_index"))

rm(ind_m)


##Create a new dataset with the indicators that you want to import

main_m <- main %>%
  select("_index", pop_groups, end_result) ## add variables here

ind <- left_join(main_m, ind, 
                 by = c("_index" = "_parent_index"))

rm(main_m)



####ind cleaning 

###Before you start creating variables for further disaggregation, CLEAN your RMS data!
###You can get inspired from below steps to help you with your primary cleaning in addition to the steps below



####Step 3. ind Type Conversion 
####Use functions like as.numeric(), as.character(), or as.Date() to convert ind types as needed

####Step 4. Document your cleaning decisions
####Document the ind cleaning steps and decisions using comments in your R script or
##a separate documentation file.
# Add comments in your script or R Markdown to explain what changes were made and why.


# Step 5.  Perform Exploratory ind Analysis (EDA)
# Conduct EDA to understand the distribution, relationships, and patterns in the cleaned ind.
# Visualize the ind using plots or charts to identify any anomalies.

####EDA Analysis


###NOTE THAT -  You can access the respective codes for response options within your KoBo form

#####Summary Statistics: Compute basic statistics like mean, median, standard deviation, 
####and quartiles for numerical variables using the summary(), mean(), median(), sd(), quantile(), or summary() functions.


###Histograms: Create histograms to visualize the distribution of numerical ind using the hist() function.

# Example of a histogram

##For instance you should check below and confirm that there are no adults below 18

hist(main$HHH01_age, main = "Histogram of the age of household head")
hist(main$HH07)


####Bar Plots: For categorical ind, create bar plots to visualize the distribution using the barplot() 
####or ggplot2 package.


# Example of a bar plot

barplot(table(main$pop_groups), main = "Population groups")


###Scatter Plots: Visualize relationships between two numerical variables using scatter plots with plot() or ggplot2. 
####This helps identify correlations and patterns.

# Example of a scatter plot
plot(ind$num_var1, ind$num_var2, main = "Scatter Plot")



# After performing these primary ind quality checks, your data should be validated and ready for calculation of the variables


# Compare Results with Expectations
# Compare the results of your analysis with your expectations to identify discrepancies.

# Document the Validation Process
# Keep detailed records of the checks, validations, and their outcomes for future reference.

# If issues or discrepancies are identified during validation, you may need to revisit the ind cleaning process and make necessary adjustments.



####Remove variables that you do not need for further data manipulation


# Create a new dataset with only required variables

###For individual dataset

vars_to_remove_ind <- c("hhroster_pos_aux", "ageMD", "age18above", "age_est", "month_est", "position", "position18",
                        "Relation_R", "adult18", "women_b_count", "women_b", "father_b", "childLess2", "childLess2name",
                        "women", "father", "adult", "adult_sum", "adult01")

ind <- ind[, !(names(ind) %in% vars_to_remove_ind)]

###For main dataset


vars_to_remove_main <- c("namechild2less", "nochildless2", "women_name_b_total", "women_name_b", "father_name_b",
                         "women_name", "father_name", "random1ap", "random1ap2", "eadult_nap", "eadult_nap2",
                         "epositionap", "epositionap2", "random_indexap", "random_indexap2", "selected_adultap",
                         "selected_adultap2")

main <- main[, !(names(main) %in% vars_to_remove_main)]



#####Export datasets for RIDL upload as cleaned versions

#### Individual dataset

# Specify the file path where you want to export the dataset

file_path <- "path/to/your/directory/your_data.csv"

# Export the 'ind' dataset to a CSV file at the specified file path
write.csv(ind, file = file_path, row.names = FALSE)

# Check if the file was created at the specified path
if (file.exists(file_path)) {
  cat("Dataset exported to", file_path, "\n")
} else {
  cat("Export failed\n")
}



#### Main dataset

# Specify the file path where you want to export the dataset

file_path <- "path/to/your/directory/your_data.csv"

# Export the 'ind' dataset to a CSV file at the specified file path
write.csv(main, file = file_path, row.names = FALSE)

# Check if the file was created at the specified path
if (file.exists(file_path)) {
  cat("Dataset exported to", file_path, "\n")
} else {
  cat("Export failed\n")
}
